***Notes on Geolocation***
You're right to focus on option 3, using the BIN (Bridge Identification Number) for cross-referencing. This is likely the most reliable method to obtain accurate geolocation data for the bridges. Here are some potential datasets and resources that could be used for cross-referencing:

1. New York State GIS Clearinghouse:
The NYS GIS Clearinghouse provides various geospatial datasets, including some related to transportation infrastructure. They have a dataset called "NYS Bridge Points" which includes BINs and coordinates[1].

2. NYS Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) Data:
NYSDOT maintains several datasets that might be useful:

   a. Highway Data Services: They provide various data files, including bridge data that might contain geolocation information[1].
   
   b. NYSDOT Bridge Data: While not directly accessible, you might be able to request more detailed bridge data, including coordinates, from NYSDOT using the BINs as reference.

3. National Bridge Inventory (NBI):
The Federal Highway Administration maintains the NBI, which includes location data for bridges. You could potentially match the BINs from your dataset with the NBI data[1].

4. OpenStreetMap (OSM) Data:
While not official, OSM often includes detailed information about infrastructure, including bridges. You might be able to match some bridges based on their features and approximate locations.

5. NYS Office of Information Technology Services (ITS):
They might have access to more detailed GIS data for state infrastructure that isn't publicly available. You could inquire about accessing this data for research purposes.

6. County and Municipal GIS Departments:
Many counties and larger municipalities maintain their own GIS data, which might include more detailed information about local bridges.

To use these resources:

1. Start with the NYS GIS Clearinghouse "NYS Bridge Points" dataset, as it's likely to be the most comprehensive and official source.

2. For any missing data, cross-reference with the NBI dataset.

3. For remaining gaps, consider reaching out to NYSDOT or NYS ITS directly for assistance.

4. As a last resort, use the county and municipality information to check local GIS resources.

Remember that accessing some of these datasets might require official requests or permissions, especially for detailed infrastructure data. Always ensure you're using the data in compliance with any usage agreements or restrictions.
