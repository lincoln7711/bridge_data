percentage of poor condition bridges relative to total
comparisons of year built to condition
geolocation of bridges and conditions based on county/city
last inspection date comparisons
relative list of owners and the status of their bridges

1. Temporal analysis of inspections:
   - Frequency of inspections by owner or region
   - Average time between inspections
   - Correlation between inspection frequency and bridge condition

2. Age analysis:
   - Distribution of bridge ages
   - Correlation between age and poor status
   - Identification of the oldest bridges still in good condition

3. Owner performance:
   - Comparison of bridge conditions across different owners
   - Average age of bridges by owner
   - Percentage of poor condition bridges by owner

4. Regional comparisons:
   - Bridge density by county or municipality
   - Comparison of bridge conditions across different regions
   - Identification of regions with the oldest or newest bridge infrastructure

5. Feature analysis:
   - Most common features carried or crossed by bridges
   - Correlation between feature type and bridge condition

6. Historical trends:
   - Bridge construction patterns over time
   - Changes in bridge design or materials based on construction year

7. Maintenance patterns:
   - Correlation between year built/replaced and inspection frequency
   - Identification of bridges overdue for inspection

8. Critical infrastructure:
   - Identification of bridges on major routes or crossing significant features
   - Analysis of condition for these critical bridges

9. Material analysis (if data is available):
   - Comparison of bridge conditions based on construction materials
   - Longevity of different bridge materials

10. Environmental impact:
    - Correlation between bridge condition and proximity to water bodies
    - Analysis of bridges crossing environmentally sensitive areas

11. Traffic impact (if data is available):
    - Correlation between bridge condition and traffic volume
    - Identification of high-traffic bridges in poor condition

12. Budget allocation analysis:
    - Estimation of required maintenance based on age and condition
    - Prioritization of bridges for repair or replacement

13. Predictive modeling:
    - Development of models to predict future bridge conditions based on current data

These analyses can provide valuable insights into the state of bridge infrastructure, help prioritize maintenance and replacement efforts, and inform policy decisions regarding infrastructure investment.
